# Nuke Node Assets

Use `gizmo_create_from_group` for portable production assets. It publishes an
existing Group under the isolated root configured by
`DCC_MCP_NUKE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, with a stable dotted id, semantic version, typed
bounded knobs, and ordered input contract. Executable callbacks are rejected.
Use `gizmo_instantiate` by id/version and `gizmo_validate` for hash, dependency,
clean-load, render, and channel-preservation evidence.

The earlier path-based `package_gizmo`, `instantiate_gizmo`, and
`inspect_gizmo` tools remain for compatibility. They do not provide the
registered-asset security contract and should not be used for untrusted assets.
`inspect_gizmo` accepts both legacy and registered-asset manifest knob layouts.

Package a new version to a new filename. Instance-preserving graph upgrades are
not part of this skill yet.
