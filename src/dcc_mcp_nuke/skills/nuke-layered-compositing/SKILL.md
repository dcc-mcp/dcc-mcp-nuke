# Nuke Layered Compositing

Use `build_layered_comp` with layers ordered bottom-to-top, then render the
returned Write node with `render_write_node`. For a multilayer EXR, reuse its
path with a `channel` per pass and ordered `grade`, `material_gain`, or `blur`
adjustments. Declare `required_layers` when missing AOVs must fail before save.
